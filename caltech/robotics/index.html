      <h1>Thruster Mount and Land Support Design for Robotics Team</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I was active on the Caltech Robotics Team for a little over half of my junior year. My task was to design the thruster mounts for our small autonomous submarine. The thrusters were prototypes from the manufacturer VideoRay so I had to design the mounts to conform to their provided CAD. Initially the &lsquo;foot&rsquo; of the vertical thruster mount was supposed to be on the inside, but the instrument teams requested it to be moved outside. Because of this, the assembly had to be reinforced with an extra piece attaching it to the submarine. Pocketing was also added to the &lsquo;foot&rsquo; due to weight considerations.</p>
