      <h1>Four-State ‘Clap-On/Clap-Off’ Circuit</h1>
    </header>

    <p>Before I switched majors to mechanical engineering, I took a circuits class as part of the applied physics curriculum. It was largely about the applications of op-amps, along with some other useful active circuit elements like transistors and flip-flops. For the final project I designed a &lsquo;clapper&rsquo; circuit which would cycle between four states (00,10,01,11) to light up two LEDs in the four different configurations possible. Sound is received by a condensor mic, then the preprocessing starts with a bandpass filter to prevent sounds like footsteps and speaking from triggering the device, a preamplifier, and a hysteretic comparator or Schmitt trigger to convert the mic signal from analog to digital. The Schmitt trigger in turn outputs to a vibrator circuit, which includes a 555 timer, to convert the trigger event (a clap) to a fixed width pulse of the appropriate amplitude. Lastly, this feeds into two cascaded flip flops which each output to one of the two LEDs.</p>
<p>For added convenience, I designed the system for a 5 V input and soldered power cables to a cannibalized flash drive plug to be able to power the system from a phone charger or computer.</p>
<p>Although the block diagram is lost to time, I still have a nice demonstration video.</p>
